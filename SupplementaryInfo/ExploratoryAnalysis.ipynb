    "This project consists of large quantities of data sourced from the following sources\n",
    "1. **nfl-data-py library:** A python library containing data related to NFL teams, players, schedules, stadiums and more.\n",
    "    - Free and easy\n",
    "    - Different sections of data (Player stats, injuries, schedules...) must be retrieved in their individual tables\n",
    "    - Seemily efficient format\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **The Odds API:** An API hosted [here](https://the-odds-api.com/) to retrieve betting odds and data relating to desired sports.\n",
    "    - Free version or various pay up front plans based on request quantity.\n",
    "        - Due to the amount of requests I'll need to make, I'm currently paying for the cheapest plan.\n",
    "    - Game based bets or individual player props. For this project, I'll especially be focused on player props.\n",
    "        - Player props are actually very new to their API. They are still improving them and will be adding more returned data.\n",
    "            - I'm hoping that improvements include deduction in the amount of requests needed to get different props."

    "Looking at this, we can infer that it stats for a punter on special teams, so not someone who usually throws the ball. But, the Carolina Panthers ran a trick play that involved him throwing a single pass. You can see that he threw for 7 total passing_yards, despite having -4 passing_air_yards. This means, the reciever caught the ball 4 yards behind the line of scrimage, but still ran it 7 yards further than the line of scrimage. This concept can be reinforced by inspecting the 'passing_yards_after_catch' variable being equal to 11. If the reciever had not caught the ball, passing_air_yards would still be -4, but passing_yards would be 0 since it only includes completions."

    "This table is dynamic with a 'date_modified' column so we can see how a players injury is potentially improving over time. We can view the practice_primary_injury column to see what the injury is, and then the 'practice_column' variable to see if it effected their practice. We are also able to see if a player missed practice due to a non-injury, such as needing rest or being ill. You can see that the report_primary_injury column is not always filled when the practice_primary_injury is. This is because a player's injury can improve to the point that they don't get listed on the finaly injury report, that's due before the game starts. \n",

The biggest issue I see, is not being able to uniquely identify palyers if they have the same name as someone else, since their is no player_id. I contacted the API team and asked about plans to add this, or even a player position variable and was informed they have plans coming to introduce a way to identify players, but their actual approach is not decided yet. Until then, I will need to figure my own approach out, that can also tie with my other data source. I anticipate this being one of my biggest challenges."

The quantity of information is not too much, although once we want to use many years of data, the weekly player stats will grow in size fairly drastically. The other files should remain very manageable, due to their natural overwrite / update system enforced by the data source. \n",

    "This data source is still relatively new, and actively being improved. Until then, their are some aspects that seem less than ideal, such as no player_id or position being returned by the API. This makes it seem nearly impossible to identify a unique player if they share a name with someone else. They have plans to fix this in the near future, but the ETA is unspecified. I hope to see them also decrease the number of requests needed to get all the props, because right now it requires a lot of them to get all the different types of bets, and I'm having to pay for the cheapest version of the API, versus taking advantage of the free version.\n",

    "- Making sure all the tables from nfl-data-py are efficiently tied together."
